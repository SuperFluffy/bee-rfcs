# Summary

Hash functions in IOTA are sponge construction which usually hash an internal start to absorb input stream and output
stream in any desired length after permutation. That means they all share similar structure we are able to abstract
with. The goal of this RFC is to model this Sponge layer as trait. Making low-level hash algorithms provide same logic
interface exposed to user, and let high-level module able to loosely couple from them.

# Motivation

It's true that everyone can just use each hash function they want directly. But we should still prevent from any of
these algorithm is too tightly coupled to upper module when we integrate this. Take proof of work for example, it will
have a module called PearlDiver mainly to deal with hashing. In the past, it already switched from curl-p to kerl.
Imagine these two functions have totally different API, it would be difficult to refactor. Same thing is going to happen
when we migrate to troika or other secure cryptography primitives in the future. So defining a trait for sponge is the
best and necessary approach for us. 

# Detailed design

// TODO: Demonstrate what sponge construction is

```rust 
pub trait Sponge {
	/// Absorb trits into the sponge
	fn absorb(&mut self, trits: &[Trit]);
	/// Squeeze trits out of the sponge and copy them into `out`
	fn squeeze(&mut self, out: &mut [Trit]);
	/// Reset the sponge to initial state
	fn reset(&mut self);
}
```

# Drawbacks

// TODO
Why should we *not* do this?

# Rationale and alternatives

// TODO
- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not
  choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

# Unresolved questions

// TODO
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process
  before this gets merged?
- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation
  of this feature before stabilization?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be
  addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this
  RFC?
